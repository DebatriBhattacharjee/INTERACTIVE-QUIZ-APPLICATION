*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK* : An interactive quiz is a dynamic and engaging tool designed to test knowledge, reinforce learning, or entertain users through a series of questions. It typically presents questions one by one, accepts user input (e.g., multiple-choice selections, text entry), provides immediate feedback on correctness, and often keeps a score. IN DESIGNING THIS INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION I HAVE USED 3 EDITOR PLATFORMS. THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS -

A)INDEX.HTML EDITOR PLATFORM WHICH IS A HTML FILE 
B)STYLE.CSS EDITOR PLATFORM WHICH IS A CSS FILE
C)SCRIPT.JS EDITOR PLATFORM WHICH IS JAVASCRIPT FILE

I HAVE DESIGNED THIS INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION WITH THE HELP OF VISUAL STUDIO CODE OR VS CODE WHICH IS A EXCELLENT SOURCE CODE EDITOR AND SOFTWARE AS WELL. THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT ONLY APPLICABLE FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT BUT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AS WELL SUCH AS PYTHON PROGRAMMING, JAVA PROGRAMMING ,C++ PROGGRAMMING, ETC. THE INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION CAN BE USED IN VARIOUS PURPOSES SUCH AS EDUCATION, ONLINE LEARNING, CORPORATE HIRING, GAME SHOWS AND QUIZ COMPETITIONS, BRAND AWARENESS, MARKETING, ENTERTAINMENT, ETC. THIS TASK IS VERY HELPFUL FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE WILLING TO DO QUIZ. THIS APPLICATION CONTAINS DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUIZ WHICH ARE VERY USEFUL AS IT HELPS US TO KNOW MANY THINGS WHICH ARE NOT KNOWN TO PEOPLE. THIS WILL HELP TO ENHANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE BY ATTEMPTING THIS QUIZZES. I HAVE DEVELOPED THIS APPLICATION WITH THE HELP OF HTML CSS AND JAVASCRIPT FILE. THUS, THIS IS HOW INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION IS APPLICABLE IN EACH AND EVERY FIELD.
